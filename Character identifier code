Write code to count the number of strings in list items that have the character w in it. Assign that number to the variable acc_num

items = ["whirring", "wow!", "calendar", "wry", "glass", "", "llama","tumultuous","owing"]
x=0
a=0
for a in items:
    print(a)
    if "w" in a:
        x=x+1
        
acc_num=x
